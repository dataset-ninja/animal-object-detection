**Animal Object Detection** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the eco industry.

The dataset consists of 2694 images with 32028 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *zebra*, *wildebeest*, *impala*, and other: *giraffe*.

Each image in the Animal Object Detection dataset has bounding box annotations. There are 2 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (287 images), *valid* (530 images), and *train* (1877 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the [Roboflow community](https://universe.roboflow.com/animal-detection-yvpsn).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
